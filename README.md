# SPT_DayTimeCultists

SPT 3.7.1+ ONLY

Farming Cultists giving you nightmares? Can't see anything in the dark? This is a simple client mod that allows cultists to spawn during any day time raid.

All credit goes to Lua, the creator of this mod.

This is a simple client mod that allows cultists to spawn during any day time raid. 

THIS IS NOT A SPAWN MOD - this mod only changes the logic that restricts cultist spawns during the day, nothing more. It should be compatible with anything.

To install:
1. Download zip
2. Extract to SPT folder
3. Play

To un-install:
1. Delete 'DayTimeCultists.dll' from your plugins folder: BepInEx\plugins\
2. Play


How do I know if this is loaded/working properly?

Well, if Cultists spawn during the day then it must be working!

Other than that, if you look at your BepInEx logs as you load your game you should see this:
```
[Info   :   BepInEx] Loading [DayTimeCultists 1.0.0]
[Info   :ModulePatch] Enabled patch CulitstSpawnPatch
```
